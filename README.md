# Overview

As a software engineer, I'm constantly exploring new programming languages and technologies to broaden my skills and knowledge. This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in Erlang by implementing a simple interactive calculator.

The Erlang Calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on a running total, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, displaying the current total, and clearing the total.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using Erlang OTP (Open Telecom Platform), which provides a robust framework for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. The code was written and tested in a Linux environment using the Erlang shell for interactive development.
